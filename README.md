# 3d-parts

Some parts for 3d printing projects. 

Made with OpenScad. 
Need https://github.com/revarbat/BOSL2 for a lot of things.

## Code
The modules are located under src/. Examples on how to use are under examples/, including some stl files and a bat file for making it easier to save multiple parts.
